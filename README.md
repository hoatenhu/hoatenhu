### 👋 Hey there! I’m @hoatenhu

🚀 I love turning ideas into real-world apps and building things that (hopefully) make life easier or more fun!  
💡 Currently exploring the magic of **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Python**, and even some good old **C/C++**.  
🎯 Always curious, always coding — from IoT to web, from AI experiments to blockchain side quests.  

<!--
🤝 Open to collabs on cool projects — ping me if you’ve got something exciting!
📬 Reach out via carrier pigeon... or maybe just GitHub for now 😄
